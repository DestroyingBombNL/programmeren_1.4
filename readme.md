## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to strengthen social connections by making it easier for people to share a meal together. The idea is to facilitate the collective sharing of meals as a means of fostering community engagement. To ensure feasibility and explore its potential, the project will start on a small scale.

Here's a breakdown of how the project works:

User Registration: Users can register in the system to create an account.

Meal Offerings: Registered users can offer one or more meals. Each meal has specific properties such as a description, an image, and information about whether it is vegetarian or vegan.

Date and Time: Each meal is offered on a specific date and time, allowing users to plan and schedule their participation.

Meal Participation: Other users who are interested can sign up to participate in a meal. They may be required to pay a small fee as a contribution towards the meal.

The overarching goal of the project is to facilitate meaningful interactions and social connections among individuals by providing a platform for sharing meals together. By bringing people together around a shared dining experience, the project aims to foster community engagement and create opportunities for new connections and friendships to form.
